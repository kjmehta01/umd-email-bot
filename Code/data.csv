We want our Spring 2022 Commencement ceremony and all others that follow to be bigger and better than ever before. Commencement is our time to unite, make connections and celebrate. While this means we will no longer host winter commencement ceremonies, academic units will hold celebratory events to honor graduates and their families. We also want our graduates to have the opportunity to celebrate with more guests than in past years. Because of the new location in Maryland Stadium, all graduates will now be allotted six tickets so that more family and friends can be included for this momentous occasion.We thank our community for embracing these new traditions and look forward to our celebrations in the spring.

3,29-Mar-22,"Terrapin Progress, Achieved Together","On my first day in office, I announced 12 initiatives and recommendations to reaffirm our commitment to our core mission and values, and to one another. I am grateful that due to the work of our incredible staff, faculty and students, we have fulfilled these commitments. My two priorities remain strong - to promote excellence in everything we do, and to create an inclusive, multicultural campus environment where every person can reach their full potential. These initiatives foreshadowed our mission to pursue excellence and impact for the public good as outlined in Fearlessly Forward: The University of Maryland Strategic Plan.            ",https://president.umd.edu/articles/terrapin-progress-achieved-together,"Dear fellow Terrapins,Earlier today, U.S. News & World Report released its annual rankings of the Best Graduate Schools. I am so proud that 56 programs, schools and colleges at the University of Maryland were ranked in the top 25. With the addition of our outstanding overall and undergraduate rankings in its Best Colleges edition released last fall, UMD now has a total of 74 top 25 rankings from U.S. News. This is up from 60 total undergraduate and graduate programs ranked in the top 25 in 2016. These rankings are just the latest in an impressive list of university accomplishments over the past two years.On my first day in office, I announced 12 initiatives and recommendations to reaffirm our commitment to our core mission and values, and to one another. I am grateful that due to the work of our incredible staff, faculty and students, we have fulfilled these commitments. My two priorities remain strong - to promote excellence in everything we do, and to create an inclusive, multicultural campus environment where every person can reach their full potential. These initiatives foreshadowed our mission to pursue excellence and impact for the public good as outlined in Fearlessly Forward: The University of Maryland Strategic Plan. Improving the Student ExperienceDuring a time of extreme stress and uncertainty, I’m proud of the work we’ve done to support the mental and physical health of our entire campus community. We've provided funding to the Counseling Center to support the hiring of seven new clinicians. The new clinicians will join the Center's multicultural and diverse staff and help expand the treatment services offered to students. The Division of Student Affairs also hired a Program Coordinator for Immigrant and Undocumented Student Life in 2020. Through the UndocuTraining series, the coordinator continues to educate our community about the unique challenges our undocumented students face and the resources available to them on campus, as well as across the state. As we concluded our $1.5 billion Fearless Ideas: The Campaign for Maryland fundraising campaign last year, we were able to raise more than $334 million toward student support, including scholarships, awards and programs and nearly $2 million in donations to the Student Crisis Fund providing critical aid to more than 3,000 students since the pandemic began. This generosity from our community is enhanced by the work of our Government Relations team and congressional delegation, which resulted in more than $29 million for emergency aid to our students with financial need during the pandemic. Creating an Inclusive EnvironmentWe launched the TerrapinSTRONG initiative with the goal of creating a shared vision and values for the entire campus community centered on improving the sense of community, connection and inclusion on our campus. The cornerstone of the initiative is an onboarding program for all new faculty, staff and students. I am proud of how our new and existing community members have embraced this shared goal - to date more than 15,000 new and existing students, faculty and staff have enrolled in the onboarding program.It was my honor last fall to be part of the dedication of the new Pyon-Chen residence hall, which sits next to the near-completed Johnson-Whittle Hall, and to take part in the ground blessing ceremony for the Yahentamitsi dining hall named in honor of the Piscataway Tribe. We also recently broke ground on the plaza in honor of Lt. Richard Collins III on campus. Cementing these names on our campus is an important part of recognizing and honoring our past and the trailblazers who came before us. The University Senate recently passed a series of revisions to the General Education Diversity Requirement, which will give undergraduate students the opportunity to tackle important issues like historical and systemic racism, and focus on civic engagement, communication and resolving conflicts. I look forward to seeing these changes continue to move forward through the work of the implementation working group. The Task Force on Community Policing, which was made up of faculty, staff and students, completed its comprehensive report and we are already in the process of implementing its recommendations for enhancing community safety on and around our campus. The 2020 election was an opportunity for civic engagement and participation for our campus community. The right to vote is fundamental, which is why we were proud to host a polling location at XFINITY Center with a secured ballot dropbox for early or absentee voter ballots, and request flexibility by supervisors to give employees the opportunity to vote. We made it a priority to give our community access and support for voter registration and voting by mail, and encourage participation in the 2020 Census. Advancing the UniversityWe achieve more when we listen. That’s why my tenure as president - and the provost’s first months in her new role - were spent inviting feedback. This happened in virtual and in-person meetings, candid conversations, and submitted feedback. The Voices of Maryland Listening Sessions helped sharpen the focus, and will continue to tap our Terrapin community for your expertise and input.My two priorities for our university will never be possible without advancing student, faculty and staff diversity on our campus. We have made great strides in access. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we made the important decision to make our university SAT/ACT test optional, and began accepting the Common App for freshman applications. In conjunction with our robust recruitment efforts, these initiatives resulted in more than 50,000 applications for freshman admission. This past fall, a majority of our freshman class were students of color for the first time in our history. Last year we launched the FAMILE initiative with the goal to add over 100 underrepresented faculty members to our tenure track ranks over 10 years. To date, we have hired 15 new faculty members across several schools and colleges. We are proud of these accomplishments and will continue our work to create a multicultural and inclusive campus.The Division of Research launched the new Research Leaders Fellows Program in the fall of 2020. The first cohort of the program included 18 participants representing every school and college on campus. As a national preeminent research institution, our goal is to conduct cutting-edge research that positively impacts the grand challenges of our times. The university continues to grow, exceeding $650M in research awards and $530M in annual research expenditures in FY21.Our very own David Driskell, Distinguished University Professor in the College of Arts and Humanities and recognized worldwide as an artist, scholar and historian of African American art, passed away at the age of 88 in March 2020 from complications of COVID-19. In one of my final conversations with him, I expressed my excitement about showcasing his work in the University House. While he, unfortunately, never got to see it come to fruition, I still wanted to honor my commitment to him. Today, his art is proudly displayed as a reminder of his talent and as a tribute to the many lives our community has lost to the coronavirus.In conclusion Every achievement was made through collaboration. Twenty months, 12 initiatives. We did this together. While there is much work that lies ahead, I am fiercely proud of our collective accomplishments. Now, we will use Fearlessly Forward: The University of Maryland Strategic Plan to guide us as we pursue inclusive excellence and impact for the public good. Sincerely,"
4,17-Mar-22,Enhancing Public Safety and Community Policing,"In the first months of my presidency, I charged a Community Policing Task Force to provide recommendations to enhance public and community policing to help move our campus toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and our university community.            ",https://president.umd.edu/articles/enhancing-public-safety-and-community-policing,"Dear campus community,In the first months of my presidency, I charged a Community Policing Task Force to provide recommendations to enhance public and community policing to help move our campus toward more collaborative and trusting partnerships between our public safety officials and our university community. This work came at a unique moment in our history, as part of our nation’s reckoning with racial injustice. I believed it was our duty to consider new approaches that would ensure a greater sense of community safety and trust, particularly among those who are most vulnerable to discriminatory police actions.Under the leadership of co-chairs Gregory Ball, now Vice President for Research, and Bonnie Thornton Dill, Dean of the College of Arts and Humanities, the members of the Task Force conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our current practices, surveyed peer institutions and conducted listening sessions with members of our community. Their comprehensive report demonstrates the care and attention the entire Task Force took in this critical work. I thank them all for their dedication and diligence.The Public Safety and Community Policing Report outlined 23 recommendations for improving and enhancing public safety efforts in our community. After careful consideration of the full scope of the report, we will begin implementation of the recommendations below. Some of these recommendations have been long-standing practices and others have been recently adopted. General Campus and Community RecommendationsEngage mental health personnel to serve as first responders for mental health calls;Establish equitable, transparent and explicit policy, practices and guidelines regarding security at campus events;Develop a Memorandum of Understanding between the Division of Student Affairs and the Department of Public Safety (DPS) to develop a student-centered approach to policing;Enhance and more fully implement existing community policing programs;Continue DPS meetings with its student advisory committee on a regular basis;Continue regular and ongoing diversity training for police officers;Establish a program of restorative and transformative justice to establish safety and community in the face of different kinds of harm;Revise the DPS mission statement to align more closely with the mission of the university;Recommendations for Police Training, Policies and PracticesContinue to conduct annual in-service training for all DPS officers on de-escalation, anti-discrimination, anti-retaliation, anti-harrassment, use of force, implicit bias, equity, diversity and inclusion; Continue to require mental health screenings for all police officers prior to hiring;Continue training DPS personnel on appropriate defensive tactics;Create and maintain coordinated protocols for cross-jurisdictional incidents with Prince George’s County, Riverdale Park and Maryland Park and Planning;Review the use of tasers, non-lethal weapons and increase the use of non-sworn staff for routine patrols;Review current DPS procedures for reporting departmental statistics and implement a website that allows public access to this data;Implement DPS policy and procedures to ensure better publicity of departmental resources and reports;Review DPS modes of notifying campus and community members about on- and off-campus incidents;Review the number of blue light cameras and off-campus lighting;Publicly report contracts and other agreements DPS has with Prince George’s County and other police departments;Create a program to bolster communication and knowledge between DPS and the campus community, explore opportunities for this to be a for-credit program;Consider developing contracts for temporary assignments for DPS officers with outside agencies to promote professional development; andImplement a policy for uniform business cards for all DPS personnel to include resources for registering complaints or compliments.After deliberation, we have chosen to modify the implementation of two Task Force recommendations – (1) the establishment of an independent Office of Community Safety and (2) a new Policing Review Board. In lieu of these measures, I will establish a Campus Safety Advisory Council, with Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer Carlo Colella and Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion Georgina Dodge serving as Chair and Vice-Chair respectively, and it will be comprised of faculty, staff and undergraduate and graduate students to assist in the implementation of the above-mentioned recommendations. It is also worth noting that recent state legislation established additional accountabilities for law enforcement organizations, including a Police Accountability Board, that would oversee police units including the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD).The Department of Public Safety – the officers and staff of UMPD – have played a vital role in keeping our campus community safe. We are grateful that crime rates on our campus continue to decline. UMPD also provides services beyond campus borders, including concurrent jurisdiction in sections of the city of College Park, with a population of over 32,000. In 2021 alone, DPS provided more than 98,000 services to our community, including welfare and crisis interventions. They have also initiated several new community initiatives, such as the partnership with Lights On and the establishment of a comfort dog program. I would like to take this opportunity to personally thank every member of the UMPD for their work in keeping all of us safe. Under the direction of Chief David Mitchell, UMPD has been responsive and amenable to continual improvement, and a valued partner to our entire campus. I also want to thank community advocates, who have championed change and progress, for helping us set up structures that emphasize accountability in community policing, with an eye toward compassion and fairness for all.One of the four core pillars of our university’s new strategic plan is to “invest in people and communities.” I believe the work of the Task Force and the implementation of these recommendations represent a major advance in this strategic commitment. Our university is better today for this important endeavor.Sincerely,"

We greatly appreciate the General Assembly’s ongoing support of our capital requests, which is transforming our campus and the state’s economy. Together, we are constructing the state’s future. The University deeply appreciates all that your support makes possible.We have three projects in our capital request this year. Two projects, Chemistry Building Wing 1 Replacement and the Interdisciplinary Engineering Building, will provide new and improved space that significantly enhances the University’s research, education, and innovation capabilities. Much of the work in this space will contribute to the state’s skilled workforce and its knowledge economy. The third project, Campuswide Building System and Infrastructure Improvements, will replace failing infrastructure and help prevent major service interruptions, improve safety and reduce ongoing maintenance costs.As in previous projects, the cutting-edge research and education supported by the chemistry and engineering spaces will translate into new private sector and federal partnerships. For example, the University is now a major innovation hub in fields such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence—greatly enhanced by the General Assembly’s previous capital support. These facilities will have a similar magnetic effect on talent and investment, spurring innovation in fields including energy, sustainability, health, transportation and unmanned vehicle systems.Facilities renewal needs and space shortages remain our greatest long-term programmatic and fiscal challenges. With these projects, we will advance the state’s strategic goals for the economy and workforce, as well as the 55 percent college completion goal.Facilities Renewal NeedsWe have an estimated facilities renewal need of over $1.1 billion on our main campus: $850 million for the 8.2 million GSF of state-supported buildings and $300 million for exterior infrastructure such as roads, sidewalks and underground utilities. We are addressing the most critical needs through ten-year CIP and institutional facilities renewal plans.Two of our CIP projects this year address facilities renewal. One project seeks to renovate and replace portions of the Chemistry Building, a facility in very poor condition. The other project requests $5M to renew failing infrastructure. In some notable cases we have lost major faculty because of sub-par conditions.Space ShortagesBased on state formulas, we currently have a shortage of 1.35M NASF of state-supported space, which is 24 percent of our existing inventory of about 5.7M NASF. Roughly one half of this shortfall (0.7M NASF) is in research space. These space shortages are very significant and of great concern, and the proposed new Interdisciplinary Engineering Building will help address this. Further details regarding our space shortages are attached.Download FY2023 Capital Budget Testimony (PDF)"

",https://president.umd.edu/articles/covid-19-update-indoor-mask-mandate,"Dear campus community,Earlier today, Prince George's County announced the lifting of the indoor mask mandate, effective Monday, February 28. This follows a previous announcement by Governor Larry Hogan lifting indoor mask requirements in all state buildings and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) also just released updated guidance.The lifting of indoor mask mandates at the county, state and national levels follows significant declines in COVID-19 health metrics. The current positivity rate in the state and in Prince George’s County is now below 3.0 percent and hospitalizations statewide have dropped to fewer than 500.Lifting the Indoor Mask Requirement on CampusOur practice since the beginning of this pandemic has been to closely follow national, state and county health guidance. With this in mind, we are adjusting our COVID-19 health measures as follows:Effective Monday, February 28, we will lift the indoor mask mandate on campus for all faculty, staff, students and visitors, with a few notable exceptions: KN95 masks will continue to be required in all classroom settings, including shared laboratories and other instructional spaces. This measure remains in place out of an abundance of caution, given the increased density over a prolonged period of time in many instructional settings. Instructors may continue to remove their masks while teaching, provided they maintain 6 feet distance from others.Masks should also be worn by anyone who is positive or has symptoms of COVID-19 or has been exposed to someone with the virus.Masks will continue to be required on all public transportation, including Shuttle-UM buses.Masks will continue to be required in all patient care areas, including, but not limited to, the University Health Center and all COVID-19 testing locations.Masks will no longer be required in offices, dining halls, residence halls or at athletic events. These updated protocols are subject to change as conditions warrant.The lifting of the indoor mask mandate is thanks in large part to our university’s high vaccination and booster rates and diligent compliance with other health guidelines. While we are pleased that the positivity rate, hospitalizations and other health metrics continue to improve, we strongly encourage everyone to remain vigilant. Wearing a KN95 mask provides effective protection against the spread of the virus, and some of us may be more comfortable with continuing to wear a mask in a variety of settings. Individuals who are unvaccinated, are immunocompromised and have chronic health conditions placing them at higher risk of severe illness and complications from COVID-19 are advised to continue to wear a mask in all settings. Thank you all for your patience and understanding as we have navigated this pandemic together. Today represents an important moment, but let us remain vigilant.
